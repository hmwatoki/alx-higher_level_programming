My journey in Python begins.

# If-Else Loops and Functions Project

## Overview
This project is part of the curriculum for the ALX SE Bootcamp. The goal of this project is to provide a practical introduction to if-else loops and functions in Python. The project includes several code examples that demonstrate how to use if-else loops and functions to control program flow and organize code.

## Requirements
To run the code in this project, you will need Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Usage
To run the code examples in this project, you can use any Python IDE or command-line interface. Here are the steps to run the code:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Python script that contains the code example you want to run. For example, to run the if-else loop example, type `python if_else_loop.py` in the terminal.
## Conclusion
By completing this project, I had a better understanding of how to use if-else loops and functions in Python. I can now apply these concepts to my Python projects to improve code organization and control program flow.
