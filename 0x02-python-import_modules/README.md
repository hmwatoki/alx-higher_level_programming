# Importing Modules and Functions in Python 
 
Welcome to my ALX SE bootcamp project about importing modules and functions in Python! This project was created as a way for me to learn more about how to import modules and functions in Python, and I hope that it will be useful to others who are just starting to explore this topic as well. 
 
## What is a Module in Python? 
 
A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix  .py  appended. For example, if you have a module named  my_module.py , you can import it into your Python script using the  import  statement. 
 
## How to Import a Module in Python 
 
To import a module in Python, you simply use the  import  statement followed by the name of the module. Here's an example:
`import my_module`

`my_module.my_function()`
In this example, we're importing a module named  my_module  and calling a function named  my_function  that is defined in that module. 
 
## How to Import Functions in Python 
 
To import a specific function from a module in Python, you can use the  from  statement followed by the name of the module and the name of the function. Here's an example:
```
from mymodule import myfunction

my_function()
```
In this example, we're importing a function named  my_function  from a module named  my_module . 
 
## How to Import Functions with Aliases in Python 
 
You can also use the  as  keyword to give a function or module a different name when you import it. Here's an example:
```
from mymodule import myfunction as mf

mf()
```
In this example, we're importing a function named  my_function  from a module named  my_module , but we're giving it the alias  mf . 
 
## Conclusion 
 
I hope that this project has helped you to understand how to import modules and functions in Python! If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to me. 
 
And remember, when in doubt, just  import antigravity ! (Just kidding, please don't actually do that.)
