 #Welcome to my Python project on more Data Structures:

This is my project for the ALX SE bootcamp on more Python Data Structures: Lists, Tuples. I'll be learning we how to use these structures to store and manipulate data like a pro. But before we dive in, let me introduce myself.

My name is Harry, and I'm a Python enthusiast. I love using this language. It's really cool :)
